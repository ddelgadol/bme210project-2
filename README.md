# bme210project-2
 #The intended function of our teamâ€™s design was a meArm system that included the following functions: 
 defending a game zone against a white ball being launched into it with a camera,
 launching the ball using a catapult-like attachment, and being able to switch between these so-called modes.
 This project was done for the BME210 SP23 class
